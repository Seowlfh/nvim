# nvim
My neovim configuration.

In order to use it for yourself, you'll need to download [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim). 

If you're on linux, you can use
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Then, you can open Neovim and use the command `:PackerSync` to synchronize the packages.
